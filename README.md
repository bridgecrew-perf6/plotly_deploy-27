# plotly_deploy
## Overview
This project allows to visualize via graph charts the information in a belly button bacteria research project, taking parameters such as washing frequency, bacteria cultures found and bacteria cultures per sample. These parameters are displayed in dynamic tables in order to keep a better look of the data recollected.

## How to use the web page
